The code provided here is strictly for use as an assessment of my coding style.
It will generally NOT compile, since it requires numerous proprietary files
(i.e. from Carnegie Mellon University), a very specific environment (little endian 64 bit machines), etc. However, in the correct environment, every piece of code here will compile without error, particularly with the -Wall -Werror flags for .c files.
